# liri-node-app
With this project, I have created an app that allows the user to input text on the command line and will get a specific response to what they input. I will attach screen shots down below of how to get started!

## Why build this project?
This app is a cool way to help users explore how the command line/terminal work while being able to return specific data based on what someone inputs. It is a fun project to play around with and see what it is capable of.

## How to get started!
To use this app, you need to have git bash. The logo should look something like this ![Image of Yaktocat](../images/Screenshot(5).png).
Once you have made your way to the terminal and clone the app to your computer, you can get started. There are 4 basic commands you can do. Movie-this, concert-this, Spotify-this-song and do-what-it-says. I will show you examples of how wach of these work.

1) **spotify-this-song:** ![spotify example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/images/Screenshot(2).png) If you look on the first line you can see an example of how to path into the app. This might change a little based on where you cloned the file to. On the second line is an example of how to get started with spotify. Always start with **node liri.js spotify-this-song song title**. Once you have that input, press enter and you should have an output look something like this
 ![spotify example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/images/Screenshot(3).png). You should get to see the Artist name, the song name, the album name and a link to preview the song. If you do not put in a song then it will auto output "the Sign" by Ace of Base.  ![spotify example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/images/Screenshot(6).png)

2)**concert-this:**  ![concert example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/images/Screenshot(4).png) With the concert-this command, the input is exactly the same layout but with a band name on the end. You should get an output that looks like the picture. It will tell you the venue name venue location and the date the venue is. You might get multiple outputs but this is because that band has multiple upcoming concerts! If you do not put a specific band into the command line it will auto output Maroon 5.

3)**movie-this:**  ![movie example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/images/Screenshot(7).png) With the movie-this command, it works just like the others but with a movie title. Your output should return the title of the film, the year it was made, 2 separate ratings, where it was produced, the language and a basic plot summary. If no movie is entered into the command line, the dark knight will be output.
